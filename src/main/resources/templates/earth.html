        <p th:text="#{theBluePlanetText1}">Our first stop in the Terran system is a small planet that could only be described as the most beautiful
            sight in the entire solar system. Sparkling before us is a bright blue gem of dazzling complexity. Delicate
            white clouds dance above its surface of brilliant blues, greens, and browns. This is the planet Earth. It is
            the third planet from the Sun, and it is our home. Only slightly larger than Venus, Earth is the largest of
            the four terrestrial, or rocky inner planets in the Solar System. It is also the densest of the four.</p>
        <p th:text="#{theBluePlanetText2}">There are two very important factors that distinguish this planet from all others in the Solar System. First,
            it is the only planet known to contain liquid water on its surface. It is the availability of this water
            that gives rise to Earth's second unique feature. It is the only known planet to support life!</p>

        <h3 th:text="#{planetOfLife}" class="mt-3 border-bottom border-altGreyLight text-lightGreen mb-4">Planet of Life</h3>
        <p th:text="#{planetOfLifeText1}">The surface of Earth is literally covered with water. Nearly 3/4 of the planet's surface is liquid water.
            Water is also found in abundance as ice in the planet's poles and as water vapor in the atmosphere. Most of
            this water was thought to have been deposited by billions of years of volcanic activity. Some scientists
            believe that water may also have been brought to Earth by early comets. It is this water, combined with
            Earth's perfect distance from the Sun, that has given rise to the Solar System's only known life forms.</p>
        <p th:text="#{planetOfLifeText2}">The atmosphere also played an important factor, providing the right mixture of gases and helping to protect
            the surface from meteor impacts. Because of these perfect conditions, Earth has evolved an unimaginable
            diversity of millions of different life forms. Life on Earth has adapted to all types of environments,
            including the land, oceans, and air. At least one of these has become self-aware and has begun to explore
            its surroundings. We humans have become the first form of life to leave their planetary home and explore the
            universe.</p>

            by the space shuttle. Earth is the only planet in the Solar System known to have liquid water on its
            surface.</p>

        <h3 th:text="#{featuresOfEarth}" class="mt-3 border-bottom border-altGreyLight text-lightGreen mb-4">Features of Earth</h3>
        <p th:text="#{featuresOfEarthText1}">Earth is a rocky world that is still very much alive and active. Volcanic activity continually creates new
            land while earthquakes reshape the landscape. Earth's surface is constantly changing. The crust is divided
            up into several "plates" (somewhat like a cracked eggshell) that float on a sea of molten rock. Where these
            plates collide, the land is thrust upwards to create enormous mountain ranges. The tallest of these
            mountains, Mt. Everest, rises 29,028 feet (8850 m) above sea level. In some places, one plate sinks
            underneath another forming deep valleys and trenches. The deepest of these, the Marianas trench, plunges
            seven miles (11 km) beneath the sea.</p>
        <p th:text="#{featuresOfEarthText2}">Uneven heating of Earth's atmosphere, combined with its rotation causes complex weather patterns. Wind and
            rain gradually erode the mountains and create vast sandy plains. Even though the planet was bombarded by
            asteroids and meteors throughout its early history, erosion has wiped out most of the craters. Some can
            still be found, however. Meteor crater in Arizona is over a mile (1.6 km) wide and almost 600 feet (183 m)
            deep. It is believed that large meteors may have caused mass extinctions throughout Earth's history. One of
            these may have been responsible for wiping out the dinosaurs. Although the planet may seem calm and tranquil
            now, its surface is highly active and ever changing on the wider geologic scale of time.</p>
