aboutTheProjectSummary=This is my project for the individual Project Assignment for the Spring Advanced Course at SoftUni. I chose this topic because I’ve always been fascinated by the wonders of the universe. The project aims to take the user on an adventure around our solar system and introduce him to the captivating world that lays beyond our planet. Once the user registers, he will have access to all the community’s posts, and you will be able to post too. As the name of the projects suggests, I will continue expanding it and add new information and features in the future. Let me know if you have any questions or suggestions. I hope you like my little project and hopefully you learn something new.

sunTitle=The Sun
sunSummary=The heart of our solar system and its gravity is what keeps every planet and particle in orbit.
aBallOfHotGas=A Ball Of Hot Gas
aBallOfHotGasText=We start our journey through the Solar System at the center. Here we find a gigantic ball of gas so massive that the immense pressure has ignited a fusion reaction. It is an average-sized yellow star known as the Sun. It is one of the most common type of star in the universe. Here in this cosmic furnace, hydrogen atoms under unimaginable pressures are being fused into helium atoms, releasing a tremendous amount of energy. Scientists believe that this reaction has been taking place for almost 5 billion years, and will likely continue for another 5 billion years. At that time, the Sun's hydrogen supply will have been depleted, and heavier elements will begin to fuse. This will cause the star to swell to the size of a red giant, consuming most if the inner planets in the process. Eventually the Sun will end its life as a cold lightless body known as a black dwarf.

solarFactsText=The Sun is the largest body in the Solar System. It has a diameter of over 863,482 miles (1,390,000 km). The nuclear reactions taking place within the Sun drive its surface temperature to over 10,832° F (6,000° C). Solar radiation is measured in wavelengths that include radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, x-rays, and gamma rays. Like all other bodies in the Solar System, the Sun rotates on its axis. Unlike the others, its equatorial region rotates faster that its Polar Regions. The equatorial region rotates once every 27 days, while the Polar Regions rotate every 34 days.
picFour=Side by side comparison of the size of the Sun vs Earth, Uranus, Saturn & Jupiter
featuresOfTheSun=Features of the Sun
featuresOfTheSunText=Although the light from the Sun seems constant to us, the Sun is far from stable. Magnetic storms and anomalies cause a number of unique phenomena. Dark spots can sometimes been seen on its surface when viewing through a solar filter to reduce the light. Known as sunspots, they are actually parts of the surface that are several hundred degrees cooler than the surrounding areas. Tremendous flames of hot gas called solar flares and prominences shoot out several hundred thousand miles into space. A stream of ionized particles known as the solar wind blows out into the far reaches of the Solar System at speeds of up to a million miles per hour. The Sun provides us with a unique opportunity to study what makes a star work. It is the only star in the universe that is close enough for us to see its surface.

messengerOfTheGodsText=The next stop on our tour is a small, barren world called Mercury. It is the closest planet to the Sun and the smallest planet in the Solar System. Mercury was named after the ancient Roman messenger of the gods because it moved across the sky much faster than the other planets. In fact, Mercury completes one orbit around the Sun in only 88 days! The planet has a very slow rotational period. It takes 58 days for Mercury to make a complete rotation on its axis. Because of its close proximity to the Sun, it can only be observed in the sky in the east just before sunrise or in the west just after sunset. It never appears more than 27 degrees away from the Sun.

aHotAndColdBarrenWorldText=Mercury has almost no atmosphere. Scientists believe that a thicker atmosphere may have existed at one time, but was stripped away by the strong solar winds. The atmosphere on Earth helps to maintain a relatively uniform temperature around the planet. By contrast, the temperature on Mercury ranges from 800° F (427° C) during the day, to -279° F (-173° C) at night. It is indeed a very inhospitable world.
mercuryPicFour=artist's rendering of rupes (cliffs) on that extend for hundreds of miles on Mercury. These giant cliffs are believed to have formed when Mercury¹s interior cooled and the entire planet shrank slightly as a result.
featureOfMercury=Features of Mercury
featureOfMercuryText1=Mercury was first visited by NASA's Mariner 10 space probe in 1974. In a series of three flybys, the probe managed to map most of the planet's surface. When the photos were received on Earth, the features might easily have been mistaken for the Moon. Mercury's surface, however, is almost completely covered with craters. The moon has more open areas known as maria, which are mostly crater-free. Mercury has only one major open area known as the Caloris Basin. These open areas are thought to have been formed by more recent volcanic flows, which may have covered the older craters. The surface is also marked by steep cliffs, also known as rupes, which rise as much as 6300 feet (1920 m) above the valley floors.
featureOfMercuryText2=In 2008, a second spacecraft passed close to Mercury. This spacecraft was named MESSENGER, which stands for MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry and Ranging. MESSENGER brought high resolution cameras to the planet and revealed many new features and new terrain not previously seen on the Mariner mission. MESSENGER is scheduled to enter orbit around Mercury in March 2011, where it will spend a full year mapping the planet's surface. New images from MESSENGER show that Mercury's surface is more homogeneous, ancient, and more heavily cratered, unlike the surfaces of the Moon and Mars.

goddessOfLoveAndBeautyText=Our next stop on the tour brings us to a planet completely covered by wispy white clouds. This is the planet Venus, and it is the second planet from the Sun. Venus is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. It is also known as the jewel of the sky, and as the morning star. Venus is so bright in the sky that it has been known since prehistoric times. Venus is sometimes referred to as Earth's sister planet, as both are nearly the same size and have nearly the same mass. Venus differs from all other bodies in the Solar System because it rotates from east to west. It is, in a sense, upside down. Another odd fact about this planet is that its day is longer than its year! Venus takes 225 Earth days to make one complete revolution around the Sun, while it takes 243 days for Venus to rotate once on its axis.

aCloudCoveredGreenhouse=A Cloud Covered Greenhouse
aCloudCoveredGreenhouseText=Contrary to its outward appearance, Venus is a very inhospitable world. The planet is covered by a thick atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide. It contains almost no water vapor. The atmosphere is so thick in fact, that the pressure at the surface of the planet is 92 times that of Earth. Carbon dioxide allows solar radiation in, but prevents it from escaping back into space. This works very much like a greenhouse, and because of this "greenhouse effect", temperatures on the surface rise to over 900° F (482° C). To make things worse, the thick layer of clouds in the atmosphere is composed of sulfuric acid droplets. There is no water on Venus, but pools of strong sulfuric acid may be found. Beneath its innocent and delicate wispy cloud tops, however, Venus could easily be mistaken for Hades, the underworld.
venusPicFour=The Russian spacecraft Venera 13 took this image of the surface of Venus on March 1, 1982. The spacecraft survived on the surface for 2 hours and 7 minutes before it was destroyed by the intense heat and pressure.
venusFeatures=Features of Venus
venusFeaturesText=Until recently, the dense cloud cover on Venus prevented every attempt to get a look at its surface. The U.S. Mariner spacecraft could only send back pictures of a world shrouded in clouds. The real breakthroughs came with Pioneer Venus in 1978, Magellan in 1990, and with two Soviet space probes in 1982. Pioneer Venus was able to do some low resolution mapping of the surface. The two Soviet Venera probes landed on the surface, but could only send back a few poorly aimed pictures before they were destroyed by the intense temperature and pressure. Nevertheless, they did show a barren rocky terrain. Magellan used high definition radar to map the planet in detail, and revealed a relatively young surface. It consists of plains covered by lava flows, and highland regions formed by geological activity. Thousands of volcanoes and numerous impact craters dot the surface. Venus is a very active planet undergoing constant change.

Sparkling before us is a bright blue gem of dazzling complexity. Delicate white clouds dance above its surface of brilliant blues, greens, and browns. This is the planet Earth. It is the third planet from the Sun, and it is our home. Only slightly larger than Venus, Earth is the largest of the four terrestrial, or rocky inner planets in the Solar System. It is also the densest of the four.
theBluePlanetText2=There are two very important factors that distinguish this planet from all others in the Solar System. First, it is the only planet known to contain liquid water on its surface. It is the availability of this water that gives rise to Earth's second unique feature. It is the only known planet to support life!

planetOfLife=Planet of Life
planetOfLifeText1=The surface of Earth is literally covered with water. Nearly 3/4 of the planet's surface is liquid water. Water is also found in abundance as ice in the planet's poles and as water vapor in the atmosphere. Most of this water was thought to have been deposited by billions of years of volcanic activity. Some scientists believe that water may also have been brought to Earth by early comets. It is this water, combined with Earth's perfect distance from the Sun, that has given rise to the Solar System's only known life forms.
planetOfLifeText2=The atmosphere also played an important factor, providing the right mixture of gases and helping to protect the surface from meteor impacts. Because of these perfect conditions, Earth has evolved an unimaginable diversity of millions of different life forms. Life on Earth has adapted to all types of environments, including the land, oceans, and air. At least one of these has become self-aware and has begun to explore its surroundings. We humans have become the first form of life to leave their planetary home and explore the universe.
earthPicFour=The Sun reflects off the Earth's vast, blue oceans in this stunning image captured by the space shuttle. Earth is the only planet in the Solar System known to have liquid water on its surface.
featuresOfEarth=Features of Earth
featuresOfEarthText1=Earth is a rocky world that is still very much alive and active. Volcanic activity continually creates new land while earthquakes reshape the landscape. Earth's surface is constantly changing. The crust is divided up into several "plates" (somewhat like a cracked eggshell) that float on a sea of molten rock. Where these plates collide, the land is thrust upwards to create enormous mountain ranges. The tallest of these mountains, Mt. Everest, rises 29,028 feet (8850 m) above sea level. In some places, one plate sinks underneath another forming deep valleys and trenches. The deepest of these, the Marianas trench, plunges seven miles (11 km) beneath the sea.
featuresOfEarthText2=Uneven heating of Earth's atmosphere, combined with its rotation causes complex weather patterns. Wind and rain gradually erode the mountains and create vast sandy plains. Even though the planet was bombarded by asteroids and meteors throughout its early history, erosion has wiped out most of the craters. Some can still be found, however. Meteor crater in Arizona is over a mile (1.6 km) wide and almost 600 feet (183 m) deep. It is believed that large meteors may have caused mass extinctions throughout Earth's history. One of these may have been responsible for wiping out the dinosaurs. Although the planet may seem calm and tranquil now, its surface is highly active and ever changing on the wider geologic scale of time.

goddesOfTheMoonText=As we finish exploring the wonders of Earth, we turn our attention to a large, cratered object orbiting only 238,800 miles (384,400 km) away. This is Earth's moon, and it is the planet's only natural satellite. Although we call it simply "the Moon", it is associated with the Roman goddess Luna, who was goddess of the hunt and of the Moon. It is the sixth largest moon in the Solar System, and has been Earth's partner for most of the planet's known history. Although it has been lighting our dark nights for so long, its origins are mostly unknown. Some believe it was formed when a gigantic asteroid smashed into the Earth. The resulting impact flung molten material far out into space where it cooled and formed the Moon we see today. Others believe it was a wandering planetoid captured by the Earth's gravitational pull. Wherever it came from, it has fascinated mankind for centuries. The Moon is the only planetary body whose surface can be seen from Earth with the naked eye.

theMoonFootstepsText=Our fascination with the Moon came to an exciting climax in 1969. On July 20, Neil Armstrong became the first human being to step onto an alien world. The crew of Apollo 11 left their footsteps behind as a tribute to the spirit of human exploration. Five other Apollo missions soon followed. By the time these missions had ended, a total of ten men had walked on the Moon's surface. Their tasks included surveying, mapping, setting up experiments, and collecting samples of rock and sand. The Moon's surface is now littered with evidence of our visits. The remains of 6 lunar landers can be found along with various scientific experiment packages and several American flags. We now know a great deal about our partner in space. Recent unmanned missions have continued mapping the surface and have even detected the presence of water ice on the surface. The presence of water is important if we are to ever establish a permanent base on the Moon.
theMoonPicFour=Earth rises above the horizon as the Apollo 11 spacecraft orbits the Moon. The Moon actually appears stationary in the sky from the Moon's surface because the same side of the Moon always faces the Earth.
theMoonFeatures=Features of the Moon
theMoonFeaturesText1=Perhaps the most prominent features of the Moon are its numerous craters. Its surface has been bombarded continually throughout its history. Since the Moon has no measurable atmosphere and no liquid water, there is no erosion taking place. This has preserved the many thousands of craters on its surface.
theMoonFeaturesText2=Another prominent feature on the Moon are the smooth areas called maria. The maria are believed to have been formed by more recent lava flows which have covered over the older craters. There are also many mountain ranges and rift valleys on the Moon's surface. All of these features have combined to form a unique facial feature known as the "Man in the Moon" that can be seen if one knows what to look for. This feature is visible every night of the year because the Moon always keeps its same face towards the Earth. This is because its period of rotation and revolution are the same; 29 days, 12 hours and 44 minutes.
theMoonFeaturesText3=This cycle is known as the lunar month As the Moon orbits the Earth, it appears to change shape as more or less of its sunlit side is visible. When the Moon is on the opposite side of the Earth as the Sun, it appears as a full moon. When it is on the same side, it is invisible, also known as a new moon. Since it is so close to the Earth, the Moon's gravity pulls on our oceans and creates the tides.

godOfWarText1=With the Terran system well behind us, we next encounter a beautiful, bright red world. This is the planet Mars, and it is the fourth planet from the Sun. It was named after the Roman god of war because its color reminded observers of a bloody Roman battlefield. Early astronomers believed they could see faint, dark lines crossing the surface of the planet. Some believed these to be artificially built canals. This gave rise to some of the early speculation of intelligent life on Mars. These lines were later found to be an optical illusion. Later unmanned missions to the planet found no evidence of the so-called canals.
godOfWarText2=Still, there is perhaps no other body in the Solar System that has intrigued us more than Mars. To this very day, it is still one of the most likely candidates for extraterrestrial life. In fact, meteorites recently discovered in Antarctica are believed to have originated from the red planet. These ancient Martian rocks may contain fossils of tiny bacteria. If this turns out to be true, it will be the first evidence that life evolved on other planets besides Earth.

theRedPlanet=The Red Planet
theRedPlanetText1=The bright red color of Mars has earned it the name of red planet. This unique color is caused by the chemistry of its surface. Mars does have a thin atmosphere, which helps cause iron compounds to oxidize. It is this iron oxide in the rocks and sand that gives the planet it reddish-brown color. It could very appropriately be called the "rusty" planet.
theRedPlanetText2=We have learned a great deal about Mars in the last few decades. Several unmanned space missions have been sent to explore the red planet. Several Mariner spacecraft orbited the planet in the mid and late 1960's. In 1975, two Viking spacecraft landed on the surface, sending back the first color pictures of this alien world. Recently, the Mars Pathfinder mission visited the planet. A small roving vehicle known as the Sojourner Rover explored the surface sending back the sharpest pictures to date.
theRedPlanetText3=Scientists continue to be fascinated with Mars because of its similarities to Earth. Some have even suggested that we may be able to colonize the planet in the not too distant future. If the planet does turn out to be completely lifeless, it may be a candidate for a process known as terraforming. This process would involve using various chemical and biological means to make the planet warmer and the atmosphere more hospitable for human life.

featuresOfMars=Features of Mars
featuresOfMarsText1=Mars is a small, rocky world about half the size of Earth. As small as it is, however, it is a planet of extremes. Mars is the home of the largest known volcano in the Solar System. Olympus Mons is an extinct volcanic crater that rises 15 miles above the Martian surface. That is over twice the height of the tallest mountain on Earth, Mt. Everest. It is a scar so large it can be seen from Earth.
featuresOfMarsText2=Another gigantic feature of the red planet is Valles Marinares. This is the Martian equivalent of the Grand Canyon. This one is much bigger, however. Valles Marinares stretches 3000 miles (4829 km) along the surface of Mars and is 435 miles (700 km) wide at its widest point. If this canyon existed on Earth, it would stretch across the continental United States from coast to coast!
featuresOfMarsText3=During the Martian winters, the poles of the planet are covered with large sheets of water ice. Several features that resemble riverbeds suggest that there may have been running water on Mars at one time. The thin atmosphere of Mars is composed mainly of carbon dioxide. Winds of up to 300 miles per hour whip up enormous dust storms that constantly erode and reshape the surface of the planet. With an average surface temperature of 60 degrees below zero, it may not seem very hospitable. But with its thin atmosphere and abundance of water, Mars remains the most likely candidate for life anywhere in the Solar System. A future manned mission to the planet is in the works. Only then will we be able to tell if the red planet is really a dead planet.

kingOfTheGodsText1=Our first stop in the Jovian system is a truly awesome sight. It is a gaseous planet of enormous proportions. This is the planet Jupiter. It is the fifth planet from the Sun and is the largest. It is also In fact, Jupiter is almost twice the size of all of the other planets combined. Over one thousand Earths could fit inside if it were hollow. Because of its gigantic size, Jupiter was named after the king of the gods in Roman mythology. In Greek mythology, he was known as Zeus, and was famous for hurling lightning bolts at earthbound mortals.
kingOfTheGodsText2=Jupiter is the fourth brightest object in the sky, so it has been known to exist since prehistoric times. It was Galileo who discovered Jupiter's four largest moons, Callisto, Europa, Ganymede, and Io, in 1610. We now know of 79 moons in orbit around Jupiter, ranging in size from just a few miles across to nearly Earth-sized. The Jovian system is like a miniature solar system within a solar system. With so many satellites tugging on Jupiter with their tidal forces, these moons are actually causing Jupiter's rotation to slow down. These same tidal forces are also pushing the moons farther away from the massive planet.

theFamousRedSpot=The Famous Red Spot
theFamousRedSpotText1=Perhaps the most famous feature of Jupiter is its giant red spot. This spot is actually a gigantic storm system. This large blemish is a high-pressure region where the winds blow in a counter-clockwise direction at over 250 miles (402 km) per hour. The cloud tops are much higher and colder than the surrounding clouds. This accounts for the spot's darker color. With a diameter of more than 16,000 miles (25,000 km), this storm is twice the size of the Earth! Many spots and colorful bands appear and disappear in Jupiter's turbulent atmosphere, but the great red spot has been know to exist for more than 300 years. Astronomers do not yet know what forces have kept this storm together for so long. And nobody knows just how much longer it will last.
theFamousRedSpotText2=Spots of a different kind were seen in 1994 when a comet named Shoemaker-Levy 9 smashed into the planet. The comet had broken into 21 separate fragments as a result of a close encounter with Jupiter's massive gravitational forces. On July 16 1994, for seven days, these fragments bombarded the giant planet. The impacts left monstrous black scars on the Jupiter's surface. Explosive plumes several times the size of Earth were observed, and the dark scars remained visible on the planet for nearly a year. It was one of the most watched astronomical events in history, and it proved once and for all that comets do hit planets.
jupiterPicFour=Mosaic image created by the Cassini spacecraft showing details of Jupiter's cloud bands. The great red spot can be seen in addition to several other storms visible as smaller round spots.
featuresOfJupiter=Features of Jupiter
featuresOfJupiterText1=Jupiter has amazed and intrigued astronomers for centuries. It has been visited by a total of six spacecraft, including the current Galileo mission. In 1995, Galileo dropped a probe into Jupiter's atmosphere. The probe took measurements and gave us our first clues as to what was inside Jupiter's thick atmosphere. With this data, and data collected on previous missions, we now know that Jupiter is essentially a gigantic ball of gas. The planet is composed mainly of hydrogen, with helium and traces amounts of other gases. One surprising find was that there is much less water in Jupiter's atmosphere than previously expected. Astronomers believe that Jupiter has no solid surface. Instead the gases get thicker and denser as they get closer to the planet's center. The extreme pressure at Jupiter's core compresses the hydrogen into a rare liquid metallic state. The planet may also have a small, rocky core about 10 times the size of Earth.
featuresOfJupiterText2=Jupiter's outer atmosphere is extremely dynamic. Colorful bands and spots can be see rotating and changing regularly. The colors in the bands are believed to be the result of chemical reactions in the atmosphere. The Galileo probe measured wind speeds exceeding 400 miles (643 km) per hour.
featuresOfJupiterText3=A big surprise revealed by the Voyager 1 spacecraft was that Jupiter has rings, much like Saturn. But unlike Saturn's rings, Jupiter's rings are very delicate and simple. These rings are divided into three main segments, and were not known to exist prior to Voyager's discovery because they are too thin to be seen from Earth.
featuresOfJupiterText4=One other item in Jupiter's long list of oddities is its magnetic field. It is so strong that is actually extends past the orbit of Saturn. In fact, it is 4000 times stronger than Earth's magnetic field. Even stranger still is the fact that Jupiter's rotation is so fast - only 9.8 Earth hours - that the planet actually bulges out in the center. A close examination of any Jupiter photo will reveal that the planet is more oval shaped than round.

saturnTitleText=The most recognizable planet with a system of icy rings, Saturn is a very unique and interesting planet.
godOfHarvest=God of the Harvest
godOfHarvestText1=As we first enter the Saturnian system, we are presented with a sight of sheer beauty. It is a giant gas planet with a delicate system of silky rings. This is the planet Saturn. It is the sixth planet from the Sun and is the second largest in the Solar System. Saturn was named after the Roman god of agriculture and the harvest. His Greek counterpart was Chronus, the youngest of the Titans.
godOfHarvestText2=Many consider Saturn to be the most beautiful object in the Solar System. It is one of the brightest objects in the night sky, and has been known since prehistoric times. Galileo was the first person to observe Saturn through a telescope in 1610. He noticed the planet's odd shape, but was unable to figure out the significance of what he had seen. In 1659, Christiaan Huygens was able to correctly identify the odd shape as Saturn's rings. Since then, Saturn has been visited by three Spacecraft including Pioneer 11, Voyagers 1 and 2, and Cassini. The Cassini probe arrived at Saturn in 2004 and gave us spectacular new views of the planet and its moons. Saturn is surrounded by a small army of 82 known moons second only to Jupiter in number. Most of these moons are small, but seven of them are large enough to warrant further investigation.

theRingedPlanet=The Ringed Planet
theRingedPlanetText1=Without a doubt the most striking feature of Saturn is its rings. Unlike the rings of Jupiter, which were not discovered until the Voyager 1 encounter in 1979, Saturn's rings have been known to exist since 1659. This is due to the fact that the ring system is quite large and bright. It can easily be seen from Earth with a small telescope. The view of Saturn's rings from Earth actually changes from year to year. This phenomenon occurrs because the tilt of Saturn's rings changes as it orbits the Sun. Because the rings are less than a mile in thickness, they seem to disappear completely every few years when they appear on edge as seen from Earth. This change in the ring system's orientation causes the brightness, or apparent magnitude of the planet to change as well.
theRingedPlanetText2=Saturn has three main ring bands. They are identified as the A, B, and C-rings. A large gap can be seen between the A and B rings. This is known as the Cassini division, and was named after Giovanni Cassini, the discoverer the gap as well as four of Saturn's largest moons. It wasn't until the Voyager encounters with Saturn in 1980 and 1981 that the true mystery of Saturn's rings was unveiled. The ring system is really composed of seven rings with extremely complex structures. The larger rings are actually composed of many smaller ringlets. The Voyager probes also found strange radial, spoke-like structures in the rings. These are believed to be caused by dust particles. Saturn's innermost ring, the F-ring, appears to be knotted or braided. Astronomers are not sure yet what causes this strange phenomenon.
theRingedPlanetText3=The Voyager probes revealed the existence of small moons in and near the rings. They are called "shepherding satellites" because they are believed to help keep the rings in place. Without the gravitation of these moons, the ring particles might fly off into space and the rings would be lost.
theRingedPlanetText4=The origin of Saturn's rings is not well understood. They appear to be composed of millions of tiny particles of ice and rock, each in its own orbit around the planet. The size of these particles ranges from as small as a dust grain to as large as an iceberg. Astronomers believe that the rings could be the debris of one or more moons that were pulverized by asteroid or comet impacts.
saturnPicFour=This Cassini mosaic image shows that Saturn's stunning system of rings is much more complex than originally thought. They are composed of hundreds of smaller rings and gaps like the groves on a phonograph record.
featuresOfSaturn=Features of Saturn
featuresOfSaturnText1=Even though the ring system is Saturn's most striking feature, the planet is also interesting in a number of other ways. Saturn is a gas giant with a chemical composition very similar to that of Jupiter. It is composed of about 75% hydrogen and 25% helium, with traces of methane, water, and ammonia. Astronomers believe that Saturn's interior is also similar to that of Jupiter, with a core of rock and ice, surrounded by a layer of liquid metallic hydrogen. There is no solid surface on Saturn. Instead, the atmospheric gases get denser and thicker as they approach the planet's center. Saturn is also the least dense of all the planets. Its specific gravity is only 0.7, which is less than that of water. If Saturn could be placed into a giant container of water, it would actually float!
featuresOfSaturnText2=Saturn shares many other features with its close cousin, Jupiter, such as high winds and cloud banding. Winds at the equator can reach an unbelievable 1,100 miles per hour. The horizontal bands on Saturn are much fainter than those on Jupiter. The Hubble space telescope has also revealed that storms occasionally erupt in Saturn's turbulent atmosphere. Like most of the other gas giant planets, Saturn has a strong magnetic field. Like Jupiter, Saturn is visibly flattened at its poles. This is caused by the planet's rapid rotation of only 10 hours, 39 minutes. In July of 2004, the Cassini probe is scheduled to arrive at Saturn. It will orbit the planet and send back detailed images and data. It will also drop the Huygens probe into the atmosphere of Saturn's moon Titan. There it will land and sample the composition of Titan's thick atmosphere and send back images of the surface.

wifeOfCronus=Wife of Cronus
wifeOfCronusText=The next planetary encounter on our tour brings us to the domain of the ice giants. These planets differ from the gas giants because they are composed primarily of frozen water, ammonia, and methane rather than hydrogen and helium. Here we find a large, blue planet with little or no surface features. It shines like a blue green gem in the heavens. This is the planet Uranus, and it is the seventh planet from the Sun. Uranus was named after the god of the heavens in Greek mythology. According to myth, Uranus was the son and mate of Gaia the father of Cronus (Saturn) and of the Cyclopes and Titans. The planet Uranus was the first planet to be discovered in modern times. The British astronomer Sir William Herschel found it with his telescope in 1781. Before this, it had been assumed to be a star. Herschel also discovered Uranus' two largest moons, Oberon and Titania. We now know of 27 moons in orbit around Uranus. They represent a wide range of sizes and shapes. Uranus has only been visited by one spacecraft. This was the extended Voyager 2 mission. That encounter took place on January 24, 1986. Nearly everything we know about Uranus was learned at this time.

theSidewaysPlanet=The Sideways Planet
theSidewaysPlanetText=Uranus is different from any other planet in the Solar System in that its axis of rotation is tilted 98 degrees. It is nearly parallel to the ecliptic. Uranus appears to be tipped on its side. This has some interesting effects on the planet. The Sun shines alternately on the poles and equatorial regions of the planet rather than constantly shining on its equatorial regions, as on Earth. Astronomers are not sure what accounts for this strange position. One theory suggests that a massive collision with another planet-sized body may have knocked Uranus on its side. This collision is believed to have taken place very early in the Solar System's history. Another strange fact about Uranus is that its magnetic field is tilted at a 60-degree angle to its axis of rotation. This angle is only 12 degrees on Earth. An interesting effect of Uranus' sideways tilt is that the tail of the planet's magnetic field is twisted like a corkscrew.
uranusPicFour=This false-color view of the rings of Uranus was made from images taken by Voyager 2 on Jan. 21, 1986, from a distance of 4.17 million kilometers (2.59 million miles). All nine known rings are visible in this image.
uranusFeatures=Features of Uranus
uranusFeaturesText=When Voyager 2 arrived at Uranus, astronomers were expecting to find complex cloud structures similar to those on Jupiter and Saturn. But when the images finally arrived, nothing was visible but a featureless blue-green sphere. False-color images of the planet later showed that banded structures of clouds were present but were extremely faint. They are partially obscured by the overlying layer of methane. Uranus is the third of the gas giants from the Sun. It is believed to be composed of about 83% hydrogen, 15% helium, 2% methane, and trace amounts of acetylene and other hydrocarbons. It is the methane in the planet's upper atmosphere that gives it a blue-green color. This is because the methane absorbs red light. High winds in the middle latitudes of Uranus blow in the direction of the planet's rotation at up to 360 miles (580 km) per hour. Studies have shown somewhat slower winds blowing in the opposite direction at the planet's equator. Astronomers once thought that beneath these layers of clouds was a massive ocean of super-pressurized liquid ammonia and water. But data sent back from Voyager 2 seem to indicate that this is probably not the case. The internal structure of Uranus is probably very similar to that of Jupiter and Saturn, but without the rocky core and liquid metallic hydrogen center. Instead, there is probably a less-dense collection of rocky material at the core. In 1977, Earth-based astronomers discovered that Uranus, like all of the other gas giant planets, has a system of rings. A total of nine rings were identified from Earth. When Voyager 2 visited Uranus in 1986, two more rings were discovered. Two of Uranus' moons, Cordelia and Ophelia, act as shepherding moons for one of the rings. Voyager 2 also discovered that Uranus has a magnetic field. It is tilted 60 degrees from the planet's rotational axis, and is about the same intensity as the magnetic field on Earth. The magnetic field on Earth and the other terrestrial planets is probably caused by electrical currents produced in the planets' molten core. Since Uranus has no molten core, astronomers are not sure what is responsible for creating the magnetic field.

godOfTheSeasText=Leaving Uranus and its moons behind us, we next encounter Uranus's sister planet, Neptune, and its system of moons. Neptune is nearly the same size as Uranus, and its composition is extremely similar. It is also the outermost of the two ice giants. Neptune was named after the Roman god of the seas. It was discovered in 1846 by Johann Gottfried Galle of the Berlin Observatory. Neptune has 14 known moons, most of which were not discovered until after Voyager 2's encounter with the planet in 1989. Most of these moons are quite tiny and are probably captured asteroids. The largest of these moons however, has a diameter of 1,680 miles (2,700 kilometers).

theBigBlueSpotText=Since Neptune was known to be so similar to Uranus, astronomers were expecting to find another bland and featureless world when Voyager 2 arrived there in August of 1989. Much to the surprise of everyone on the Voyager team, Neptune would turn out to be anything but bland. The most startling feature to be discovered was a giant blue spot in the planet's southern hemisphere. It was very similar in appearance to the famous red spot on Jupiter, and about half the size. In 1994, observations of Neptune by the Hubble space telescope have revealed that the giant blue spot has disappeared. Recently, a new blue spot was observed in the planet's northern hemisphere. Astronomers are not sure why the spot on Neptune was relatively short-lived, while the great red spot on Jupiter has bee present for hundreds of years. This indicates that the Neptune's atmosphere is highly active and prone to sudden and severe changes. Several smaller spots were also noted, as was a small, fast-moving, cloud that astronomers named "scooter".
neptunePicFour=This Voyager 2 close-up of Neptune shows upper level clouds in the atmosphere. This was a surprise to astronomers who were expecting a more uniform atmosphere similar to that of Uranus.
nuptuneFeatures=Features of Neptune
nuptuneFeaturesText=Nearly everything we know about Neptune was learned from the Voyager 2 encounter. Like Uranus, Neptune's blue color is the result of red light being absorbed by methane gas in the planet's upper atmosphere. Neptune's composition is believed to be very similar to that of Uranus. It probably has a small, rocky core about the size of the Earth. This core is thought to be surrounded by an extremely thick layer gases composed mainly of hydrogen and helium with a little methane. Besides the mysterious dark and light spots were other fascinating discoveries. Long, white clouds were seen floating in the planet's upper atmosphere. Neptune has the fastest winds in the Solar System, reaching speeds of 1,200 miles (2,000 kilometers) per hour. Voyager 2 also revealed Neptune's system of delicate rings. There are 4 narrow rings, which are extremely faint. Astronomers think they may be composed of dust particles formed from meteorites smashing into the planet's moons. Like Uranus, Neptune's magnetic field is tilted 47 degrees from its rotational axis. Astronomers believe this is caused by internal forces deep within the planet.
