aboutTheProjectSummary=This is my project for the individual Project Assignment for the Spring Advanced Course at SoftUni. I chose this topic because I’ve always been fascinated by the wonders of the universe. The project aims to take the user on an adventure around our solar system and introduce him to the captivating world that lays beyond our planet. Once the user registers, he will have access to all the community’s posts, and you will be able to post too. As the name of the projects suggests, I will continue expanding it and add new information and features in the future. Let me know if you have any questions or suggestions. I hope you like my little project and hopefully you learn something new.

sunTitle=The Sun
sunSummary=The heart of our solar system and its gravity is what keeps every planet and particle in orbit.
aBallOfHotGas=A Ball Of Hot Gas
aBallOfHotGasText=We start our journey through the Solar System at the center. Here we find a gigantic ball of gas so massive that the immense pressure has ignited a fusion reaction. It is an average-sized yellow star known as the Sun. It is one of the most common type of star in the universe. Here in this cosmic furnace, hydrogen atoms under unimaginable pressures are being fused into helium atoms, releasing a tremendous amount of energy. Scientists believe that this reaction has been taking place for almost 5 billion years, and will likely continue for another 5 billion years. At that time, the Sun's hydrogen supply will have been depleted, and heavier elements will begin to fuse. This will cause the star to swell to the size of a red giant, consuming most if the inner planets in the process. Eventually the Sun will end its life as a cold lightless body known as a black dwarf.

solarFacts=Solar Facts
solarFactsText=The Sun is the largest body in the Solar System. It has a diameter of over 863,482 miles (1,390,000 km). The nuclear reactions taking place within the Sun drive its surface temperature to over 10,832° F (6,000° C). Solar radiation is measured in wavelengths that include radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, x-rays, and gamma rays. Like all other bodies in the Solar System, the Sun rotates on its axis. Unlike the others, its equatorial region rotates faster that its Polar Regions. The equatorial region rotates once every 27 days, while the Polar Regions rotate every 34 days.

featuresOfTheSun=Features of the Sun
featuresOfTheSunText=Although the light from the Sun seems constant to us, the Sun is far from stable. Magnetic storms and anomalies cause a number of unique phenomena. Dark spots can sometimes been seen on its surface when viewing through a solar filter to reduce the light. Known as sunspots, they are actually parts of the surface that are several hundred degrees cooler than the surrounding areas. Tremendous flames of hot gas called solar flares and prominences shoot out several hundred thousand miles into space. A stream of ionized particles known as the solar wind blows out into the far reaches of the Solar System at speeds of up to a million miles per hour. The Sun provides us with a unique opportunity to study what makes a star work. It is the only star in the universe that is close enough for us to see its surface.

mercuryTitle=Mercury
mercuryTitleText=The planet closest to the Sun, Mercury is the smallest and fastest planet in the solar system -- whipping around the Sun every 88 Earth days.
messengerOfTheGods=Messenger of the Gods
messengerOfTheGodsText=The next stop on our tour is a small, barren world called Mercury. It is the closest planet to the Sun and the smallest planet in the Solar System. Mercury was named after the ancient Roman messenger of the gods because it moved across the sky much faster than the other planets. In fact, Mercury completes one orbit around the Sun in only 88 days! The planet has a very slow rotational period. It takes 58 days for Mercury to make a complete rotation on its axis. Because of its close proximity to the Sun, it can only be observed in the sky in the east just before sunrise or in the west just after sunset. It never appears more than 27 degrees away from the Sun.

aHotAndColdBarrenWorld=A Hot and Cold Barren World
aHotAndColdBarrenWorldText=Mercury has almost no atmosphere. Scientists believe that a thicker atmosphere may have existed at one time, but was stripped away by the strong solar winds. The atmosphere on Earth helps to maintain a relatively uniform temperature around the planet. By contrast, the temperature on Mercury ranges from 800° F (427° C) during the day, to -279° F (-173° C) at night. It is indeed a very inhospitable world.
mercuryPicFour=artist's rendering of rupes (cliffs) on that extend for hundreds of miles on Mercury. These giant cliffs are believed to have formed when Mercury¹s interior cooled and the entire planet shrank slightly as a result.
featureOfMercury=Features of Mercury
featureOfMercuryText1=Mercury was first visited by NASA's Mariner 10 space probe in 1974. In a series of three flybys, the probe managed to map most of the planet's surface. When the photos were received on Earth, the features might easily have been mistaken for the Moon. Mercury's surface, however, is almost completely covered with craters. The moon has more open areas known as maria, which are mostly crater-free. Mercury has only one major open area known as the Caloris Basin. These open areas are thought to have been formed by more recent volcanic flows, which may have covered the older craters. The surface is also marked by steep cliffs, also known as rupes, which rise as much as 6300 feet (1920 m) above the valley floors.
featureOfMercuryText2=In 2008, a second spacecraft passed close to Mercury. This spacecraft was named MESSENGER, which stands for MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry and Ranging. MESSENGER brought high resolution cameras to the planet and revealed many new features and new terrain not previously seen on the Mariner mission. MESSENGER is scheduled to enter orbit around Mercury in March 2011, where it will spend a full year mapping the planet's surface. New images from MESSENGER show that Mercury's surface is more homogeneous, ancient, and more heavily cratered, unlike the surfaces of the Moon and Mars.
